learning git & github
git is free & open source

remote(github)   to    local (git) i.e laptop/pc


### 4 types of status
    1. untracked :- new files that git doesnt yet track
    2. modified :- changed
    3. staged :- file is ready to be commited
    4. unmodified :- unchanged 

changed current file (modified) 
created new file html (untracked)
will stage this file now using git terminal(staged) & changed will be made final using commit(like taking a screenshot)

## Add & Commit
    -> add - adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area
    command :- git add <file name>
    command :- git add . (this command stages every change & new file)

    -> commit - it is the record of change
    command :- git commit -m "some descriptive message about commit"
